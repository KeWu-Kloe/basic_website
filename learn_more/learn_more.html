        <!-- Why Choose this website as the main topic -->
        <h3>&#128064; Why Choose this website as the main topic?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Diverse Resources:</strong> Our content is designed to inform and inspire. The wide range of topics to cater to different interests and career stages and those ideas are interesting and meaningful.</li>
            <li><strong>Diverse Display methods:</strong> A lot of websites display themes by listing content and using vertical layouts, and the same was true for my site, and I needed to display these in a variety of creative ways during the development of the site, rather than using a monotonous vertical layout alone. I had a lot of great ideas while developing this site, like using cards, tables and carousel slides.</li>
            <li><strong>Broaden my career path and hobbies:</strong> During the development of the site, I was introduced to many career names I'd never heard of and some hobbies that I knew about but had never thought about tring to do, and I tried my hand at building Lego and filling color-filling E-books.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Reflection thoughts section -->
        <h2 class="section-title">&#128170;Reflection thoughts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Color Consistency and Contrast:</strong> Predefine a set of colors for your CSS theme and ensure high contrast between font and background colors by checking their contrast ratio before application.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible Homepage Design:</strong> Opt for a more extensible homepage rather than a static layout merely listing different elements for informational websites, akin to Wikipedia, to avoid disconnected web pages.</li>
            <li><strong>Container Standardization:</strong> Define a set number of containers in advance to facilitate maintenance in the future. Currently, containers are being continuously added directly after the CSS, which can lead to redundancy between CSS and HTML files or conflicts due to inconsistent constraints on the same element.</li>
            <li><strong>Separate Professional JS Files:</strong> Keep JavaScript definitions separate from HTML files for better organization and maintainability. Avoid embedding JS directly within HTML files.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistent Comments and Translations:</strong> Maintain consistent commenting habit.</li>
        </ul>
