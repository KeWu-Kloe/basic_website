    <h1>About my passion</h1>
    <p>My passion is broaden my personal work path and self-development! It may sounds a little boring but I do have. Broaden my work path means that I would like to try different work, for example, I have tried various kinds of internships and community work.
        But the source of passion is not about the money, it is about self-achievement and self-recognisation. 
    </p>
    <p>I love to learn different things, not just taking different courses, but also gaining more practical skills. I like to learn new sports, try different recipes or brandnew skills. I think it is important for me to step out of comfort zone and expand my hobbies.</p>
    <h1>About my topic</h1>
    <p>My topic is Me and my path, it is a website about self-development, Me and my path is a website that introduce new skills and different job types that people can choose.
    </p>
    <p>The reason why I choose this topic is that Social media nowadays selectively pushes out content that you are interested in, which tends to expose the user to only familiar content rather than new and uninformed content.
         My goal with this page is to introduce as many hobbies, and careers as possible, so that users can think about what their next experienced skill or even career oppertunities will be. 
         In this website, I can introduce many job oppertunities and interesting things that can be done after work, this website may provide users more options to do when they get some free time.
    </p>
    <p>In this world, the types of jobs are more than engineers, accountants or programmers. There are many unbelievably interesting jobs, maybe it is useful for graduated students to expand their career paths. Why not let people take a look of these excellent jobs and figure out their passion?
